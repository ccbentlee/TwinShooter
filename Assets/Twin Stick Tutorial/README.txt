Twin Stick Tutorial Shooter by  www.raywenderlich.com

****

I. Introduction

Welcome to the Twin Stick Shooter tutorial! This tutorial was produced by the Unity Team at www.raywenderlich.com. This was originally the first eight chapters of the book, Unity Games by Tutorials, but we have extracted these chapters into their own self contained Unity asset.

The purpose of this asset is to teach Unity from the ground up. You’ll learn the engine by creating a complete game from it. All the code and assets are included with this project.

II. HOW IT WORKS

This project has three main subfolders: Assets, Completed Projects, and Tutorial. 

The Assets folder contains all the starter assets for you to get started. As you go progress through this tutorial, either make all your changes in this directory, or copy them to the parent directory.

The Completed Projects contains sample scenes for all the chapters. These are good reference points in case you get stuck and want to see how a scene may be properly configured. To keep each scene unique, we provided scripts under different namespaces. If you decide to use one of these projects as a starting point, you’ll need to update your scripts to account for these namespaces.

If you are new to scripting or don’t understand the concept of namespaces, check out our free Beginning C# with Unity series at www.raywenderlich.com to learn about namespaces and how to use them.

Finally, the Tutorial folder contains the actual pdf of the tutorial. Read this at your leisure!
